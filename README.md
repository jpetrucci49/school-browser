# school-browser

Technologies used in this project include HTML, SASS, Javascript, jQuery, Handlebars, and the DOM.

This client connects to my heroku database where a user can store information on their local schools
using Ruby on Rails.

# Heroku API:

https://github.com/jpetrucci49/school-rails-api

## Planning

My plan for coding this API project was to segment it into different features to implement. Firstly, login functionality including sign in, sign up, change password and sign out. Secondly, add a new table to the database for users to add schools. Finally, to implement form handlers for user submissions and CRUD requests.
